// 2025-03-13:  Proposed NekotOS `g` API for Nekot Gaming OS.

// In the following, "Game" is what we call the user programs
// or processes or applications or apps that this OS can run.

// The source for each game lives in a separate subdirectory
// of `games/` and the main program must be in a file named
// `game.c`.  In order for the compiler to do whole-program
// optimizations, your entire program must be included in
// `game.c`, even if it means adding #include statements
// to include other `.c` files!
// Place this repo `nekotos` in your `coco-shelf`
// repo, and place the `coco-shelf` repo in your $HOME directory,
// for best chances of things working, for now.

// Notice that this "kernel/public.h" is the ONLY #include file
// you need for Nekot.
// There is no <stdio.h> or <stdlib.h> or <memory.h>,
// although we may try to provide something for the most common cases
// (like we do for memcpy, memset, and strlen, and va_{list,start,arg}).

// Soon we hope to provide some optional libraries for game authors,
// to do common things like scan the keyboard for keypresses, or draw
// pixels in a framebuffer for various screen modes.
// Look in the ../lib8 directory for some preliminary libraries.

// We compile with the 6809 port of GCC using -std=gnu99, -Os,
// -fomit-frame-pointer, and f-whole-program.

// Notice that you will not have a `main()` function.
// Instead you must divide your main program into two parts like this:
//
//   * `void setup(void)` contains only setup code.
//
//   * `void loop(void)` contains the actual game action.  The memory used by
//        setup code and setup data will be made available for re-use,
//        if you do it this way.  [ TODO: finish this feature. ]
//
// (We are using the same concept and names as Arduino Sketches use.)
//
// Your loop function must call gReceiveCast64 frequently, like at least
// every 100ms.  And you must gFree64 a message you get from there.
// Or Nekot will hit a fatal error when it runs out of memory.

// Initialized global variables containing tables and data that
// are only needed during setup can be marked with the
// attribute `gSETUP_DATA` (put it before the `=`).
//
// Small global variables (things that are one or two bytes)
// that are not explicitly initialized (called .bss variables)
// are generally fine, but you can only have 128 bytes worth
// of them.  Larger variables that are not explicitly initialized
// can be marked with the attribute `gZEROED` to move them from
// the small .bss section to a section with more space.

//  Pre-allocation

// Pre-allocating defines addresses for these

//
// Programs that start with some of these elements
// in common may chain values in memory from one
// to the other, for as many as are specified the same.

// of the specified type.

// Example:
//
// gSCREEN(T, 2);   // T for Text, needs 2 pages (512 bytes).
// gSCREEN(G, 12);  // G for PMode1 Graphics, needs 12 pages (3K bytes).
